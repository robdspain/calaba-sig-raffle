## Email Draft:

**Subject:** CalABA 2026 SIG Reception - Joint Raffle Fundraiser

Hi [Name],

I'm Rob Spain, President of the Behavior Analysts in Education SIG. Quick question for you:

We're putting together a raffle for the SIG reception at CalABA 2026 (March 6th). The plan is to raise funds for the bar and other reception costs — but here's the thing: **proceeds will be split between all participating SIGs.**

Right now we've got a few prizes lined up:
- A 1-hour Zoom with Dr. Peter Killeen
- Signed books from speakers
- Gift cards and professional development bundles

**Would your SIG want to contribute a prize?** Could be anything:
- Books or resources from your members
- A consultation or mentorship session
- Gift cards, swag, whatever you think your folks would like to win

The more SIGs that participate, the bigger the pot for everyone. And it's a nice way to bring the SIG community together at the reception.

Here's the raffle site (still adding prizes): https://calaba-sig-raffle.vercel.app

Let me know if you're interested — even just a quick "yes, we'll contribute something" would be great. Happy to coordinate logistics.

Thanks,
Rob Spain, M.S., BCBA
Behavior Analysts in Education SIG, President

## Alternative shorter version:

**Subject:** Quick idea - joint SIG raffle at CalABA?

Hey [Name],

Rob Spain here, BAE SIG President. We're running a raffle at the SIG reception (March 6) to help cover bar costs, and I'm reaching out to other SIG leaders with a simple idea:

**What if all participating SIGs split the proceeds?**

We've already got some good prizes (Zoom with Peter Killeen, signed books, gift cards). If your SIG wants to donate a prize, you'd share in whatever we raise.

Interested? Just reply and let me know what you might contribute.
